#
# Usage: ../bin/coffee-streamline diskUsage2.coffee [path]
#
# This file is a parralelized version of the `diskUsage.coffee` example. 
# 
# The `spray` function is used to parallelize the processing on all the entries under a directory.
# We use it with `collectAll_` because we want to continue the algorithm when all the 
# entries have been processed. 
# 
# Without any additional preventive measure, this 'sprayed' implementation quickly exhausts  
# file descriptors because of the number of concurrently open file increases exponentially
# as we go deeper in the tree.
# 
# The remedy is to channel the call that opens the file through a funnel.
# With the funnel there won't be more that 20 files concurrently open at any time 
# 
# Note: You can disable the funnel by setting its size to -1.
# 
# On my machine, the parallel version is almost twice faster than the sequential version.
#
