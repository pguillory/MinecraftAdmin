/*
 * Usage: node ../lib/node-init.js diskUsage2 [path]
 *
 * This file is a parralelized version of the `diskUsage.js` example. 
 * 
 * The `spray` function is used to parallelize the processing on all the entries under a directory.
 * We use it with `collectAll_` because we want to continue the algorithm when all the 
 * entries have been processed. 
 * 
 * Without any additional preventive measure, this 'sprayed' implementation quickly exhausts  
 * file descriptors because of the number of concurrently open file increases exponentially
 * as we go deeper in the tree.
 * 
 * The remedy is to channel the call that opens the file through a funnel.
 * With the funnel there won't be more that 20 files concurrently open at any time 
 * 
 * Note: You can disable the funnel by setting its size to -1.
 * 
 * On my machine, the parallel version is almost twice faster than the sequential version.
 * 
 * !!STREAMLINE!!
